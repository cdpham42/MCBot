# MCBot
Minecraft Server Discord bot

A simple Minecraft Server Status bot that will display the current number of online users and server status in the bot's status on discord.

Created to be non-reliant on current online minecraft server api sites for requesting information from servers. Instead, this uses the Minecraft Server api from DinnerBone to directly request from servers.
